#ShomreiTorah.Backup
This utility backs up tables from a SQL database to XML.
It is configured in ShomreiTorahConfig.xml and is intended to be run as a scheduled task.

#ShomreiTorah.Singularity.Designer
This program generates strongly-typed Singularity DataContext classes.  
It stores the table schema and SQL mappings in its own XML format, and generates C# (only) row classes for each table.  It does not actually use Singularity at all.
It uses DevExpress WinForms UI components.

#ShomreiTorah.UpdatePublisher
This utility publishes updates to the ShomreiTorah update system (implemented in ShomreiTorah.Common.dll).  It reads the (encrypted) private key from a separate XML file.  By default, it looks for the latest (by filename) `.private-key` file in the Config directory within the source tree. 
This XML file is generated by the Configurator and should be kept private.
Updates are uploaded to the FTP server specified in ShomreiTorahConfig.xml.

#YKLookup
This application looks up people in the master directory (connecting to the database from ShomreiTorahConfig.xml), and displays address details as well as a map.
